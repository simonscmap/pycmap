The matching results rely on the tolerance parameters because they set the matching boundaries between the source and target datasets.

Please note that the number of matching entries between each target variable and the source variable might vary depending on the temporal and spatial resolutions of the target variable. In principle, if the source dataset is fully covered by the target variable's spatio-temporal range, there should always be matching results if the tolerance parameters are larger than half of their corresponding spatial/temporal resolutions.
